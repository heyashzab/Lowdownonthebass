            <h2>“Why does your guitar only have four strings?”</h2>
            <p>While classified as a bass guitar, the electric bass is more closely related to the upright or double bass (which is not a guitar). Similar to upright bass, the bass guitar has 4 strings, which are tuned much lower than the strings on a normal guitar. The strings are usually plucked with the fingers rather than a pick (though picks have been used by guitarists switching over to bass). Upright and electric bass both serve the same function as members of the rhythm section. Aside from size and appearance, they’re bass-ically the same instrument.</p>

            <h2>The Modern Electric Bass</h2>
            <p>Amplified and fretted basses were not a new idea in 1951, when Leo Fender introduced his first electric bass—the Precision Bass—to the market. But that doesn’t detracts from the significance and importance of Fender's introduction of the solidbody electric Bass guitar in 1951. While earlier basses had made no impact on the market or on music, Fender's electric bass guitars would become industry standards. Fender didn’t even play bass (or guitar).</p>
            <p>The electric bass solved several problems associated with traditional upright bass: amplification, transportability, and intonation (the Precision Bass actually got its name from the addition of frets to the fingerboard; upright basses are traditionally fretless).</p>

            <h2>The Role of the Bass</h2>
            <p>Bass is (typically) not a lead instrument—it’s a member of the rhythm section. The role of bass is to provide a link between the harmony and rhythm. It’s arguably the most critical role, as it ties the entire band together. Remove the bass from any song and it just feels empty.</p>
            <p>Bassists help establish and maintain a steady rhythm. The bassist works closer to the drummer than the guitarist. Unlike guitarists, bassists don’t play chords (chords usually sound muddy on bass).  Bass plays a powerful role in how we hear harmonies. When we hear several notes played at once, we hear them all relative to the lowest sounding pitch — the bass note.</p>

            <h2>James Jamerson</h2>
            <h3>motown session player</h3>
            <p>James Jamerson was the uncredited bassist on most of the Motown Records’ hits of the 1960s and early 1970s and is considered one of the most influential bassists of all time. His playing was considered an indispensable part of the Motown sound. Producers would delay recording sessions by weeks just to get him on to play on a track.</p>
            <p>Jamerson is noted for expanding the musical style and role of bass playing in popular music. He contributed uniquely melodic basslines that stood out from some of the more basic pop fare of the time (and today). Jamerson’s technique and improvisational approach were greatly influenced by his background as a jazz musician and upright bassist.</p>

            <h2>Larry Graham</h2>
            <h3>thumpin’ &amp; pluckin’</h3>
            <p>Larry Graham is generally credited with the invention of slapping on electric bass, although he himself refers to the technique as "thumpin' and pluckin' ". Graham was simply trying to emulate the sound of drums on bass to flesh out the rhythm in his then drummerless band. He compensated for the missing bass drum by “thumping” the strings and made up for the missing snare drum by “plucking” the strings. Slap bass technique radically expanded the tonal palette of the bass.</p>

            <h2>Jaco Pastorius</h2>
            <h3>greatest bass player in the world</h3>
            <p>Well, that’s how Jaco Pastorius would introduce himself. Of course, many would still agree that he redefined the role and the scope of the electric bass in the world of jazz and beyond. Over the course of his relatively brief yet incredibly prolific career, he developed an influential approach to bass playing that combined complex harmony with virtuosic technique. His signature style employed Latin-influenced funk grooves, lyrical solos on a defretted Fender Jazz (which he dubbed, The Bass of Doom), bass chords, and innovative use of harmonics and looping.</p>
